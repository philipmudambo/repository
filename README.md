# QUICK GUIDE 
Here, you will find a collection of my own work sample projects including algorithms, data structures, web development  and much more. Each project might include a comprehensive README file detailing the purpose, functionality  and usage of the code thus advisable to be opened using respective software to view and run the expected output. I use have default dataset in R and also imported external datasets(credit given by embedding the links). Feel free to share my work.
*NOTE: All works under the “Code” are part of my major project work that soon will be released as an integration of the previous and current works in progress.
