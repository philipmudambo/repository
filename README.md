# repository
Here, you will find a collection of my own work sample projects including algorithms, data structures, web development  and much more. Each project might include a comprehensive README file detailing the purpose, functionality  and usage of the code thus advisable to be opened using respective software to view and run the expected output. I use have default dataset in R and also imported external datasets(credit given by embedding the links). Feel free to share my work.
